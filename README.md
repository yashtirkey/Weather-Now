# Weather Now 

Weather Now is a simple project that utilizes a weather API to display the current weather conditions of a specified location. The project is built using React and CSS. The user can enter a location or use their current location to see the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant weather information. The project also includes a user-friendly interface that displays the information in an easy-to-read format. The goal of this project is to provide an easy and quick way for users to check the current weather conditions of any location.
